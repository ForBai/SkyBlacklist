# Sky Blacklist
A mod that lets you blacklist specific players with or without a reason.
If a player is blacklisted, and they join your server/party/whatever, you will get a notification.
It's also possible to add a reason to the blacklist, so you can remember why you blacklisted the player.
Also if the player is blacklisted, you can auto kick them out of your party.
There is also a function that if you join a party and the player is in the party, you will auto leave the party.

## How to use

- Refactor the template (specifically, the modid, version and name in the gradle.properties and most of the class names)
  to a different name.
